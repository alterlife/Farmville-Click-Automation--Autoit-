# Farmville-Click-Automation

A simple tool to reduce the overhead of farm maintenance. Nobody plays farmville now, but when it was all the rage, this utility could harvest all your farmville crop in one click! 

Maybe useful for other similar games as well? 

# Instructions

When you middle click on a crop tile, this utility will capture an image of it and click on it and all similar tiles until none are left to harvest.
