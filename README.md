# Farmville-Click-Automation

A simple tool to reduce the overhead of farm maintenance. Nobody plays farmville now, but when it was all the rage, this utility could harvest all your farmville crop in one click! 

Middle click on a crop tile to capture an image of it and click on all similar tiles until none are left.

Maybe useful for other similar games as well?
